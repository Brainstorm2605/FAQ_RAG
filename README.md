## Core Features:
# AI-Powered Search: 
Utilizes state-of-the-art language models and embedding techniques to understand user questions and retrieve the most relevant FAQ entries.
# Contextual Understanding: 
Goes beyond keyword matching to grasp the context and intent behind user queries, ensuring accurate and helpful responses.
# Dynamic Response Generation: 
Leverages large language models to generate dynamic and informative answers, potentially going beyond the static text of existing FAQs.
# User-Friendly Interface: 
Provides an intuitive interface for users to ask questions and receive clear, concise answers.
# Continuous Improvement: 
Incorporates user feedback and evaluation metrics to continuously refine the system's accuracy and effectiveness.
## Benefits:
# Enhanced User Experience: 
Users can quickly and easily find solutions to their problems, leading to greater satisfaction and reduced frustration.
# Improved Efficiency:
